# ESP32 Debug Logging

Base URL: `http://192.168.0.87:8080`

Two logging methods are available. Choose based on your situation:

| | Serial Monitor | UDP Logs |
|---|---|---|
| **Works without WiFi** | Yes | No |
| **Boot/crash output** | Yes | No |
| **Pattern matching** | Built-in (regex + timeout) | Manual (poll + grep) |
| **Blocks serial port** | Yes (one session per slot) | No |
| **Multiple devices** | One slot at a time | All devices simultaneously |
| **Long-running** | Limited by timeout | Continuous (buffer persists) |

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/serial/monitor` | Read serial output with optional pattern matching |
| POST | `/api/serial/reset` | Hardware reset via DTR/RTS, returns boot output |
| GET | `/api/udplog` | Retrieve UDP log lines (filter by source, since, limit) |
| DELETE | `/api/udplog` | Clear the UDP log buffer |
| GET | `/api/log` | Workbench activity log (portal actions, not device logs) |

## Serial Monitor

Reads serial output via RFC2217 proxy. Optionally waits for a regex pattern.

```bash
# Wait up to 10s for a pattern match
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/serial/monitor \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"slot": "slot-1", "pattern": "WiFi connected", "timeout": 10}'

# Just capture output for 5s (no pattern)
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/serial/monitor \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"slot": "slot-1", "timeout": 5}'
```

Response: `{"ok": true, "matched": true, "line": "WiFi connected to MyAP", "output": [...]}`

### Use serial monitor when:
- You need **boot messages** (before WiFi is up)
- You need to **wait for a specific log line** (pattern matching with timeout)
- Device has **no WiFi** or UDP logging is not compiled in
- You want **crash/panic output** from the UART

### Dual-USB hub boards
- **Reset** via the JTAG slot (triggers DTR/RTS auto-download circuit)
- **Monitor** via the UART slot (where ESP_LOGI output appears)
- Boot output on the JTAG slot will be empty or minimal — the actual boot log appears on the UART slot

```bash
# Reset via JTAG slot
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/serial/reset \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"slot": "<JTAG-slot>"}'

# Capture boot output from UART slot
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/serial/monitor \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"slot": "<UART-slot>", "timeout": 10}'
```

## UDP Logs

ESP32 firmware sends debug logs as UDP datagrams to the workbench on port 5555. The workbench buffers up to 2000 lines.

```bash
# Get recent UDP logs (default limit: 200)
curl -s http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/udplog | jq .

# Filter by source device IP
curl -s "http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/udplog?source=192.168.4.2" | jq .

# Get logs since a timestamp, limited to 50 lines
curl -s "http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/udplog?since=1700000000.0&limit=50" | jq .

# Clear the buffer before starting a test
curl -X DELETE http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/udplog
```

Response format: `{"ok": true, "lines": [{"ts": 1700000001.23, "source": "192.168.4.2", "line": "OTA progress: 45%"}, ...]}`

### Use UDP logs when:
- Device is **on WiFi** and firmware sends UDP log packets
- You want **non-blocking** log collection (doesn't tie up the serial port)
- You're monitoring **multiple devices** simultaneously (filter by source IP)
- You need logs during **OTA updates** (serial may be unavailable)

### Do NOT use UDP logs when:
- Device has **no WiFi** yet (pre-provisioning, boot phase) — use serial monitor
- Firmware **doesn't include UDP logging** — use serial monitor
- You need **boot/crash output** — only serial captures UART output from early boot
- You need to **wait for a specific pattern** with a timeout — serial monitor has built-in pattern matching

## How ESP32 Sends UDP Logs

The workbench listens on UDP port **5555**. ESP32 firmware sends plain text lines:

```c
struct sockaddr_in workbench = { .sin_family = AF_INET, .sin_port = htons(5555) };
inet_aton("192.168.0.87", &workbench.sin_addr);
sendto(sock, msg, strlen(msg), 0, (struct sockaddr *)&workbench, sizeof(workbench));
```

## Activity Log

The activity log tracks workbench actions (resets, WiFi changes, firmware uploads) — not device output.

```bash
curl -s http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/log | jq .
curl -s "http://192.168.0.87:8080/api/log?since=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z" | jq .
```

## Common Workflows

1. **Verify boot after flash:**
   - `POST /api/serial/reset` — returns boot output
   - Check for expected boot messages (e.g., `boot:0x28`, firmware version)

2. **Wait for WiFi connection:**
   - `POST /api/serial/monitor` with `pattern: "WiFi connected"` and `timeout: 15`

3. **Monitor OTA progress:**
   - `DELETE /api/udplog` — clear buffer
   - Trigger OTA (see esp32-workbench-ota)
   - Poll: `GET /api/udplog?since=<last_ts>&limit=50`

4. **Debug a running device:**
   - `GET /api/udplog?source=<device_ip>` — see what it's logging
   - If empty, device may not have UDP logging — fall back to serial monitor

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Monitor timeout, no output | Baud rate is fixed at 115200; ensure device matches. For dual-USB boards: make sure you're monitoring the UART slot, not the JTAG slot |
| No UDP logs appearing | Ensure firmware sends UDP to workbench IP:5555; check WiFi connectivity |
| Logs from wrong device | Use `source` query param to filter by IP |
| Old/stale logs | Clear with `DELETE /api/udplog` before starting a test |
| Need boot output | UDP logs don't capture boot — use serial monitor. For dual-USB boards, monitor the UART slot |
| Slot shows `monitoring` | Another monitor session is active — wait for it to finish |
